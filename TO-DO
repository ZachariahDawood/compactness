USEFUL
-Add parallel support
-Change error handling in read_shapefile
-Add error handling in unreadable districts from readOGR

CRITICAL
-fix bbox and hull to make sure they're constrained 0-1. they're not handling donuts or large districts correctly. NOTE: Alaska is weird because it splits the meridian. for donuts, it's reading the hole as new area.
-replace parts with log(parts) and remove the area measures; rather,remove all scale invariant measures; maybe points should be points/perim or points/area?
-fix vignette code
